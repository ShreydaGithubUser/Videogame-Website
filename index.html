            Roblox is a game platform that lets you play games created by other people and make games of your own! When roblox started, the creator just made 3 or 4 games. Now, the players of roblox have created millions of fun games. A few of my favorite games in Roblox is Bee Swarm Simulator and Arsenal.

            Valorant is a 5v5 First-Person-Shooter game. At the start of each round, you recharge your abilities and buy guns. You are either on the attacker team or defender team. If you are on the defender team, you need to find an object called a spike, plant it, and protect it before time runs out. If you are the attackers, you have to defuse the spike that has been planted. If one team elimintaes all the players on the other team, the team left standing wins. Each character is called an agent, and they have special abilities. For example, the agent I use is called Chill. He is archer. He has special arrows like explosive arrows and an arrow that can scan for oppnets. Each agent has their stregths and weaknesses. You need to work together and use the abilities to win the match.
